/**
 * The Temporal adapter behind the core's `@ragenai/jobs` seam.
 *
 * It was built in the core as `packages/jobs-temporal`, kept to one file and
 * one engine import from the first commit precisely so that this move would be
 * a copy of one file rather than an archaeology exercise. Nothing here is new
 * behaviour; it is the code the core shipped, in the repository whose CI now
 * owes it a parity run.
 *
 * **The contract is not vendored.** `@ragenai/jobs` is a peer dependency this
 * package never installs: it resolves from inside the base worker image, where
 * `/app/node_modules/@ragenai/*` are symlinks into `/app/packages/`. So this
 * compiles against the interface the artifact actually ships rather than
 * against a version number that can skew from it — see AGENTS.md, invariant 3,
 * and the core spec's §8.5.
 *
 * **What this file is not.** It is the *producer* half: start a run, read one,
 * cancel one, keep the two schedules. The consumer half — the worker bootstrap,
 * the workflow wrappers and the `JobContext` built inside Temporal's sandbox —
 * stays in the core, because it imports the core's handlers and its 69 activity
 * modules, and the published image already carries it compiled. The core spec's
 * Phase G2 records why.
